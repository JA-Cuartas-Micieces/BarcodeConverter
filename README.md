# BarcodeConverter
PROJECT

It changes the codes in the csv files' columns of a folder, taking into account the matching codes of a table in a different .xlsx file. CodeMatch.xlsx is the input file in the same directory as BarcodeConverter.py which matches source files' column values with destination files' column values. First and last columns of CodeMatch.xlsx are the numbers of rows at the beginning and the end of CSV files, which will remain the same after running the script. Column two is the column order number in the CSV files, which will get the codes of the third column replaced by the codes of the fourth column. 

MODULES

The batch file runs BarcodeConverter.py the only script module on Windows.
